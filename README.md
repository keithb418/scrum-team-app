## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Git
Node v6.10.2

```

### Installing

```
$ git checkout development
```

Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

```
`npm run build` compiles the code into the dist directory
`node server.js` start a server on the production port
